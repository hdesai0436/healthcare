        <h1>Understaing Brain Tumors</h1>

        <h2>What is a brain tumor?</h2>
        <p>A brain tumor is a collection, or mass, of abnormal cells in your brain. Your skull, which encloses your brain, is very rigid. Any growth inside such a restricted space can cause problems.

            Brain tumors can be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). When benign or malignant tumors grow, they can cause the pressure inside your skull to increase. This can cause brain damage, and it can be life-threatening.</p>

        <p>Brain tumors are categorized as primary or secondary:</p>
        <li>A primary brain tumor originates in your brain. Many primary brain tumors are benign.</li>
        <li>A secondary brain tumor, also known as a metastatic brain tumor, occurs when cancer cells spreadTrusted Source to your brain from another organ, such as your lung or breast.</li>

        <h1 id = 'Benign vs. malignant'>Benign vs. malignant brain tumors</h1>
        <p>Though benign brain tumors can cause many serious issues, they are not cancerous, meaning that they grow slowly and don’t typically spread to other tissues.

            They also usually have more clearly defined borders, making them easier to remove surgically, and they don’t usually come back after removal.
            
            On the other hand, malignant brain tumors are cancerous, grow rapidly, and can spread to other parts of your brain or central nervous system, which can cause life-threatening complications.
            
            </p>

        <h1 id = 'type_tumore'>Types of brain tumors</h1>
        <h2>Primary brain tumors</h2>
        <p>Primary brain tumors originate in your brain. They can developTrusted Source from your:</p>
        <li>brain cells</li>
        <li>the membranes that surround your brain, which are called meninges</li>
        <li>nerve cells</li>
        <li>glands, such as the pituitary of pineal</li>
        <p>Primary tumors can be benign or cancerous. In adults, the most common types of brain tumors are gliomas and meningiomas.</p>
        <h2>Gliomas</h2>
        <p>Gliomas are tumors that develop from glial cells. These cells normally:</p>

            <li>support the structure of your central nervous system</li>
            <li>provide nutrition to your central nervous system</li>
            <li>clean cellular waste</li>
            <li>break down dead neurons</li>

        <p>Gliomas can develop from different types of glial cells.

            The types of tumors that begin in glial cells includeTrusted Source:</p>
            <li>astrocytic tumors, such as astrocytomas, which originate in the cerebrum</li>
            <li>oligodendroglial tumors, which are often found in the frontal temporal lobes</li>
            <li>glioblastomas, which originate in the supportive brain tissue and are the most aggressive type</li>
    
    <h1>Other primary brain tumors</h1>
    <li>pituitary tumors, which are usually benign</li>
    <li>pineal gland tumors, which can be benign or malignant</li>
    <li>ependymomas, which are usually benign</li>
    <li>craniopharyngiomas, which occur mostly in children and are benign but can have clinical symptoms like changes in vision and premature puberty</li>
    <li>primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphomas, which are malignant</li>
    <li>primary germ cell tumors of the brain, which can be benign or malignant</li>
    <li>schwannomas, which originate in cells that produce the protective cover of your nerves (myelin sheath) called Schwann cells</li>
<h2>Secondary brain tumors</h2>
<p>Secondary brain tumors make up the majority of brain cancers. They start in one part of the body and spread, or metastasize, to the brain. The following can metastasizeTrusted Source to the brain:</p>
<li>lung cancer</li>
<li>breast cancer</li>
<li>skin cancer</li>

<h1>What are the risk factors for a brain tumor?</h1>
<h1>Family history</h1>
<p>Only about 5 to 10 percentTrusted Source of all cancers are genetically inherited, or hereditary. It’s rare for a brain tumor to be genetically inherited. Talk with your doctor if several people in your family have received a brain tumor diagnosis. Your doctor can recommend a genetic counselor for you.</p>
<h2>Age</h2>
<p>The risk for most types of brain tumors increases with age.</p>
<h2>Chemical exposure</h2>
<p>Being exposed to certain chemicals, such as those you might find in a work environment, can increase your risk for brain cancer. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health keeps a list of potentially cancer-causing chemicals found in workplaces.</p>

<h2>Exposure to radiation</h2>
<p>People who have been exposed to ionizing radiation have an increased risk of brain tumors. You can be exposed to ionizing radiation through high-radiation cancer therapies. You can also be exposed to radiation from nuclear fallout.

    The nuclear power plant incidents in Fukushima and Chernobyl are examples of how people can be exposed to ionizing radiation.</p>

<h1>What are the symptoms of a brain tumor?</h1>
<p>Symptoms of brain tumors depend on the location and size of the tumor. Some tumors cause direct damage by invading brain tissue and some tumors cause pressure on the surrounding brain.

    You’ll have noticeable symptoms when a growing tumor is putting pressure on your brain tissue.
    
    Headaches are a common symptom of a brain tumor. You may experience headaches that:</p>
    <li>vomiting</li>
    <li>blurred vision or double vision</li>
    <li>confusion</li>
    <li>seizures (especially in adults)</li>
    <li>weakness of a limb or part of the face</li>
    <li>a change in mental functioning</li>
    <li>memory loss</li>
    <li>difficulty writing or reading</li>
    <li>decreased alertness, which may include drowsiness and loss of consciousness</li>
    <li>eye problems, such as drooping eyelids and unequal pupils</li>
<h1>Symptoms of pituitary tumors</h1>
<li>nipple discharge, or galactorrhea</li>
<li>lack of menstruation in women</li>
<li>development of breast tissue in men, or gynecomastia</li>
<li>enlargement of the hands and feet</li>
<li>sensitivity to heat or cold</li>
<li>increased amounts of body hair, or hirsutism</li>
<li>low blood pressure</li>

<h1>How are brain tumors diagnosed?</h1>
<p>Diagnosis of a brain tumor begins with a physical exam and a look at your medical history.

    The physical exam includes a very detailed neurological examination. Your doctor will conduct a test to see if your cranial nerves are intact. These are the nerves that originate in your brain.
    
    Your doctor will look inside your eyes with an ophthalmoscope, which is an instrument that shines a light through your pupils and onto your retinas.
    
    This allows your doctor to check how your pupils react to light. It also allows your doctor to look directly into your eyes to see if there’s any swelling of the optic nerve. When pressure increases inside the skull, changes in the optic nerve can occur.
    
    The doctor may also evaluate your:</p>
    <li>muscle strength</li>
    <li>coordination</li>
    <li>memory</li>
<h2>CT scan of the head</h2>
<p>CT scans are ways for your doctor to get a more detailed scan of your body than they could with an X-ray machine. This can be done with or without contrast.

    Contrast is achieved in a CT scan of the head by using a special dye that helps doctors see some structures, like blood vessels, more clearly.</p>


<h2>Angiography</h2>
<p>This study uses a dye that’s injected into your artery, usually in the groin area. The dye travels to the arteries in your brain. It allows your doctor to see what the blood supply of the tumors looks like. This information is useful at the time of surgery.</p>

<h2>Biopsy</h2>
<p>A small piece of the tumor is obtained during a biopsy. A specialist called a neuropathologist will examine it. The biopsy will identify if the tumor cells are benign or malignant. It will also determine whether the cancer originated in your brain or another part of your body.</p>

<h2>Treatment of brain tumors</h2>
<p>The treatment of a brain tumor depends on:

    the type of tumor
    the size of the tumor
    the location of the tumor
    your general health</p>

<p>The most common treatment for malignant brain tumors is surgery. The goal is to remove as much of the cancer as possible without causing damage to the healthy parts of the brain.

    While the location of some tumors allows for safe removal, other tumors may be located in an area that limits how much of the tumor can be removed. Even partial removal of brain cancer can be beneficial.
    
    Risks of brain surgery include infection and bleeding. Clinically dangerous benign tumors are also surgically removed. Metastatic brain tumors are treated according to guidelines for the type of original cancer.
    
    Surgery can be combined with other treatments, such as radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
    
    Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy can help you recover after neurosurgery.</p>
